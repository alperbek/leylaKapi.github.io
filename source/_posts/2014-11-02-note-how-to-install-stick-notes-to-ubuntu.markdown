I want to sticker notes for my pc, when I search about it, I found `sticky notes` for `Ubuntu 13.10` .
This notes provide to reminder of something like a agenda, when you wrote some notes inside, 
you see always the notes. If you want to add sticker notes you can use below command.
   
```bash
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:umang/indicator-stickynotes
```   

```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
```

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install indicator-stickynotes
```

That 's it. This notes very helpful for me .

I hope helped to you too.
