### How I can set up RubyMine for my Ubuntu Desktop ?

- Firstly, You can install rubymine on [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/download/)

Then, open your terminal

    CTRL + ALT + T

Then, go to Download file then extract from *.tar.gz* file to normal directory. Then write in terminal


```bash
cd Downloads/RubyMine-6.3/bin/
./rubymine.sh
```

Then, Rubymine opens automatically.

That's all.
